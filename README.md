# We Go Too![](/landing/assets/logo.png)

We Go Too is an IOS app which provides a social layer on top of maps' functionality, allowing users to create routes, search for existing routes around the world and invite friends to join them on those routes, with a real time GPS and chat connection. WeGoToo was conceived of by a team of four full-stack software engineers: [Rebecca Gray](https://github.com/rebeccagray), [Konstantin Zamaraev](https://github.com/zamaraevk), [Alexius Hale-Dubuque](https://github.com/alexiushaledubuque), and [Bohee Park](https://github.com/boheepark)

## Setup
During development, we have the server running on localhost port 8000, but before running locally, be sure to run:
- `npm install` to install our dependencies
- create a mySql database using the structure in the server/db/config.js file

We used the [dotenv](https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv) npm package to configure our development variables. Create a config.env file in the server directory with the following variables and their values:
DB_HOST
DB_USER
DB_PASS
DB_NAME
GOOGLE_MAPS_API
NODEMAILER
