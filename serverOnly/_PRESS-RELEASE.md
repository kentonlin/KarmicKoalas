#This app is great for group bike rides, caravan road trips, tour groups, school groups and playing tag!

#WeGoToo
WeGoToo is a social app which adds community to regular maps functionality

Users can create and share routes, add points of interest, or secret treasures, photos and tags.
Routes are stored in our searchable cloud database.

Users who are looking for some fun to share can search our routes, choose a  route to follow, and send invitations for the adventure to their friends.

Groups of users then join routes together via invitation and and have live tracking of their locations and can 
message each other on the route
